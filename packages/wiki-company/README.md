I extracted a list of companies from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_based_in_the_Philadelphia_area into Excel.
Then I pulled the link into a seperate column.
Then saved as csv in data directory called wiki-companies.csv
Then I used the follow code in this directory to find information and save it to hubspot.
